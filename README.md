#### Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  

You are reading it! For Exercise 1, 2 and 3, the code has been included in subfolders.

### Exercise 1, 2 and 3 pipeline implemented
#### 1. Complete Exercise 1 steps. Pipeline for filtering and RANSAC plane fitting implemented.
Please refer to [RANSAC.py](./Exercise1/RANSAC.py) for the completed code for Exercise 1. The required steps are graphically presented below:
1. Initial point cloud for tabletop (note .pcd not included in repository)

![image1]

2. Point cloud after Voxel grid downsampling

![image2]

3. Point cloud after Pass through filtering applied to the z-axis

![image3]

4. Point cloud of extracted inliers (table only)

![image4]

5. Point cloud of extracted outliers (objects only)

#### 2. Complete Exercise 2 steps: Pipeline including clustering for segmentation implemented.  
Please refer to [segmentation.py](./Exercise2/segmentation.py) for the completed code for Exercise 2. The graphical outputs from three topics are shown below:
1. Subscribed initial point cloud topic

![image6]

2. Published point cloud from pcl_objects topic after segmentation

![image7]

3. Published point cloud from pcl_table topic after segmentation

![image8]

#### 3. Complete Exercise 3 Steps.  Features extracted and SVM trained.  Object recognition implemented.
For the features extraction for compute_color_histograms() and compute_normal_histograms() please refer to [features.py](./Exercise3/features.py). For the color histograms, 64 bins were utilised with the range set to 0 to 256. For the normal histograms, 32 bins were utilised, with the range set to 0 to 256. For each object, 50 iterations were utilised to capture the feature vectors. The SVM was trained using a linear kernel and HSV was utilised and [capture_features.py](./Exercise3/capture_features.py) has been included for reference purposes.

The normalized confusion matrix is shown below:

Please refer to [object_recognition.py](./Exercise3/object_recognition.py) for the completed object recognition implementation. The model.sav file was generated, saved and loaded into the model. The output of the detected objects with their associated labels are shown below:

### Pick and Place Setup

#### 1. For all three tabletop setups (`test*.world`), perform object recognition, then read in respective pick list (`pick_list_*.yaml`). Next construct the messages that would comprise a valid `PickPlace` request output them to `.yaml` format.
